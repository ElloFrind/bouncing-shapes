# nzoi-code
NZOI competition code
This is the code that I wrote during the last few years of high school, competing for a place in NZ's IOI team. I never quite made it, but I went to a few training camps, and during one of the camp's competitions placed second. We covered many different algorithms tackling classic problems like shortest path, searching and sorting. We also covered dynamic programming, some data structures such as hash tables and various kinds of trees.

The code I wrote for this was designed to be written quickly and run efficiently, so some of the things I did (e.g. nearly no commenting, spaghetti code, and cin.tie(0);) I wouldn't do in an actual project.
